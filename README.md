# Mantis Place redesign

This project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Project is now being reworked for react and reactstrap.

## Done (Feb 5, 2020)

- Added "add product" button to all mantises shown

- Logicing react-redux
- Current goal: "add product" button adds the item to the cart, which is shown on that same page below the other results

## To Fix

- Code for siebar nav links (making most default to home for now) [easy to do]

## To Do (shorter term)

- Rewrite dropdown logic using hooks

## Longer Term

- Rewrite Mantis Component to be more concise
- Why is there a white space to the right?
