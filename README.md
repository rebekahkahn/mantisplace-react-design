# Mantis Place redesign

This project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Project is also being reworked for react-native.

Here is a [live preview](https://condescending-borg-73067e.netlify.app/) of the website.

## Done (June 8, 2020)

## To Fix

- Code for siebar nav links (making most default to home for now) [easy to do]
- White space to the right
- I know that the "blinking" header is due to needing to write a breakpoint, which I will do later

## To Do (shorter term)

- Add shopping cart eature

## Longer Term

- Rewrite Mantis Component to be more concise
- Why is there a white space to the right?
