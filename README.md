## Done (Jan 28, 2020)

- Added react redux to hold state in the store
- Created mantises and headers reducers
- Combined reducers with CombineReducers

## To Fix

- Code for siebar nav links (making most default to home for now) [easy to do]

## To Do (shorter term)

- Write logic for shopping cart -- redux?
- Rewrite dropdown logic using hooks

- Add React Redux
- Why is there a white space to the right?
